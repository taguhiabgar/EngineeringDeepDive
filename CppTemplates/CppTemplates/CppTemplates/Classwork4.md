#  Classwork 4

1. Function that prints arguments in a recursive order - DONE
2. integer printing function, to print also other type arguments (not ints)
3. get volume of `multi_array`
4. access by index to `multi_aray` - "<i1, i2, i3>" 

1. for "getter<>" add check for index overflow, so that index overflow is caught at compile-time
2. equality comparison of 2 tuples
3. implement access by index from right
4. add "static constexpr" field to keep the size of the tuple
